AIM
To study and understand the concept of sets in Python, including creation, modification, and common set operations such as union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference.

THEORY
Sets in Python are an unordered collection of unique elements. A set:
Automatically removes duplicate values.
Does not support indexing or slicing since it is unordered.
Allows mathematical set operations like union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference.

Key Characteristics:
Creation of Sets:
Sets are defined using curly braces {} with elements separated by commas.
Uniqueness:
If duplicate elements are added, they are automatically removed.
Adding/Removing Elements:
Use .add() to add a new element.
Use .remove() to delete an element.
Set Operations:
Union (|): Combines all elements from two sets.
Intersection (&): Elements common to both sets.
Difference (-): Elements in one set but not in the other.
Symmetric Difference (^): Elements in either set but not both.
Immutable Sets:
A frozenset is an immutable version of a set — you can’t add or remove elements once it’s created.
Example Uses:
Sets are useful when you need to store unique data, perform membership testing, or compare datasets mathematically.

ALGORITHM



CONCLUSION
The experiment successfully demonstrated how Python sets work. You learned how to:
Create and print sets.
Understand that sets do not allow duplicates.
Add and remove elements.
Perform basic set operations like union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference.
Use frozenset where immutability is required.
Thus, the aim was achieved — you now understand the functionality and importance of sets in Python, along with their core operations and characteristics.
